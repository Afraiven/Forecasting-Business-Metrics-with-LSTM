<h1>Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with LSTM</h1>
<h3>Objective</h3>
The goal of this notebook is to predict future values for each column in the dataset using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/podsyp/time-series-starter-dataset/data)

this is my first time working with timeseries, so I appreciate any comments and suggestions

<h3>Outline</h3>
In this notebook, I will walk through the following steps:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Exploration and Forecast Horizon:</strong> Initial examination of the dataset, determining the time period for predictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Detrending:</strong> Removing long-term trends from the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Deseasoning:</strong> Eliminating seasonal patterns to focus on the underlying data correlations.</li>
  <li><strong>Post-Processing Analysis:</strong> Examining the data after detrending and deseasoning to ensure these processes were effective.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training and Evaluation:</strong> Training the LSTM model on the processed data and evaluating its performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Predicting on Test Data:</strong> Making predictions on the test set to check the performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training on Full Data:</strong> Retraining the model on the entire dataset to improve its forecasting ability.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Prediction:</strong> Generating final predictions for future data points using the trained model.</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarizing the findings, discussing the results, and suggesting potential improvements.</li>
</ul>
